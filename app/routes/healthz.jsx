/**
 * Readiness probe: /healthz
 *
 * Without a health check, Coolify points the proxy at a new container the moment
 * Docker starts it. The container does not serve anything until `prisma db push`
 * has finished and react-router-serve has bound port 3000, so requests arriving
 * in that window have no listener to reach and hang until the browser gives up.
 *
 * With this endpoint configured as the health check, the proxy only sends
 * traffic once the server is actually answering, and the old container keeps
 * serving until then.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT touch the database or Shopify: it answers the one
 * question the proxy is asking — is this process ready to take a request.
